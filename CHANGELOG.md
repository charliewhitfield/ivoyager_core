## [v0.0.18] - Not Released

Under development using Godot 4.2.beta5. _Has backward breaking changes!_

Requires plugin [ivoyager_table_reader](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_table_importer) v0.0.7.dev (use current _master_ branch).

Requires non-release **ivoyager_assets-0.0.18.dev.20231019**. **_NEW! The plugin will update this for you! Just press 'Download' at the dialog prompt._** (Alternatively, download [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/non_release_assets/releases/tag/2023-10-19).)


### Added
* Assets download & version management! The editor plugin checks presence and version of ivoyager_assets, and offers to download and add (or replace) as appropriate.
* Class documentation using Godot ## tags.

### Changed
* Unlocked the time setter widget so year can be set outside of 3000 BC to 3000 AD. The widget now displays a text warning telling user that planet positions are valid in that range. (Widget used in Planetarium.)
* Improved IVSaveBuilder Dictionary handling: a) Persist objects can be keys. b) String versus StringName types are correctly distinguished and persisted as keys.
* [Possibly breaking] Optimized IVSaveBuilder with new rules for Objects in containers: Objects can be in object member Arrays (which must be Object-typed) or object member Dictionaries (as keys or values), but cannot be in nested Arrays or Dictionaries inside of Arrays or Dictionaries. (Pure "data" containers can still be nested at any level.)
* IVSaveBuilder: Improved debug asserts at game save. Throws errors on rule violations that could lead to load problems.
* [API breaking] Removed `IVUtils.free_procedural_nodes()`. Replaced usage with `IVSaveBuilder.free_all_procedural_objects()`. The new function nulls all references to procedural objects (so frees RefCounted instances having circular references) and then frees the Nodes.
* Use static vars for localized class items.
* For loop typing and error fixes for Godot 4.2.
* Removed functions `_on_init()`, `_on_ready()`, `_on_process()`, etc. These were needed in Godot 3.x because virtual functions could not be overridden by subclasses. This is no longer the case.
* Removed number & unit names from translation (now added in ivoyager_table_importer).

### Fixed
* [Migration regression] Fixed array type error causing crash in `IVTimekeeper.is_valid_gregorian_date()`.

## v0.0.17 - 2023-10-03

Developed using Godot 4.1.1.

Requires non-Git-tracked **ivoyager_assets-0.0.17**; find in ivoyager_core [releases](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_core/releases).    
Requires plugin [ivoyager_table_reader](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_table_importer) v0.0.5.

### Added
* Core submodule content previously in [ivoyager](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager) v0.0.16.

### Changed
* ivoyager_core works as an editor plugin!
* All autoload singletons, shader globals, project settings, and class definitions can be modified by editing res://ivoyager_overrides.cfg.
* Previous project settings in IVGlobal have been moved to IVCoreSettings.
* Previous class definitions in IVProjectBuilder have been moved to IVCoreInitializer.


##
I, Voyager projects v0.0.16 and earlier used a different core submodule [ivoyager](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager) (now depreciated); see previous changelog [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
